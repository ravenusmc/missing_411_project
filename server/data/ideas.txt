This file will contain some of the ideas for graphs that I want to make with the data. 

number of people missing by year - or decade? 
States with the most missing people 
-most common ages of people missing 
-Sex of people missing - allow user to select decades?
-Graph of Volume - Easter or Western US

data set only has 5 rows that appear to have all the data - quite sad...
